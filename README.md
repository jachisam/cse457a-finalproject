# Final Project: <https://jachisam.github.io/cse457a-finalproject/final/>
# Process Book: <https://jachisam.github.io/cse457a-finalproject/process-book/>
# Data: <https://github.com/jachisam/cse457a-finalproject/blob/master/data/graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict.csv>
# Code: <https://github.com/jachisam/cse457a-finalproject>
- The files that we created are: everything under /data, /images, /old_milestones
- Under /js, the files we created are histogram.js, liquidFillGauge_mod.js, main.js, main_watergauge.js, student.bar.chart.js, watergauge.js, watertank.js.
- Everything under /js/components are bootstrap, jquery and d3 v3. and v4. libraries
- Everything under /scss, /vendor /css were structurally provided by bootstrap v4. and customized for this project
- Both the project index file and the process book _structure/layout_ were based off/inspired by bootstrap structured templates.

# Sources/Libraries: <https://jachisam.github.io/cse457a-finalproject/process-book/#sources>
1. js/liquidFillGauge.js <http://bl.ocks.org/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6>
.. however we did end up making quite a few changes to the library to fit out own project, these were made in js/liquidFillGauge_mod.js
2. Bootstrap v4 <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/>
.. Bootstrap was the main component we used in making the site (and process book) look aesthetically pleasing
3. Bar Chart Help <https://bl.ocks.org/seemantk/ec245e1f4e824e685982dd5d3fbb2fcc>
..student.bar.chart.js as inspired by this. We incorporated the svg creation methods into our code. We loved the format so we adopted it for our work as it really brings out the data succinctly in our visualization.
4. Bubble Chart Help <http://vallandingham.me/gates_bubbles/>
..This implementation was initially made for donation funds and three
distinct years, however, we really liked the idea of using bubbles for
selecting items so it has been drastically modified to fit that purpose.
We kept a subset of the functions and modified all of the remain functions
to fit our dataset.
