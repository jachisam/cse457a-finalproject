# Final Project: <https://jachisam.github.io/cse457a-finalproject/final/>
# Process Book: <https://jachisam.github.io/cse457a-finalproject/process-book/>
# Data: <https://github.com/jachisam/cse457a-finalproject/blob/master/data/graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict.csv>
# Code: <https://github.com/jachisam/cse457a-finalproject>
The files that we created are: everything under /data, /images, /old_milestones
Under /js, the files we created are histogram.js, liquidFillGauge_mod.js, main.js, main_watergauge.js, student.bar.chart.js, watergauge.js, watertank.js.
Everything under /js/components are bootstrap, jquery and d3 v3. and v4. libraries
Everything under /scss, /vendor /css were structurally provided by bootstrap v4. and customized for this project
Both the project index file and the process book _structure/layout_ were based off/inspired by bootstrap structured templates.

1. js/liquidFillGauge.js <http://bl.ocks.org/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6>

2. Bootstrap v4 <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/>
.. Bootstrap was the main component we used in making the site (and process book) look aesthetically pleasing
