          College admission statistics, including those for graduate schools are always of    great interest and importance for young people who are aspiring for getting better education. We have all gone through numerous applications. Our portfolios have all gone through numerous admission committees. Even though an applicant could evaluate her or his potentials for admissions, for the most part the admission process is a black box that provides little feedback. Finding out what factors lead to admission is certainly an important research topic with practical impacts. It would be very helpful if one could look at past admission data and make an assessment before investing the energy, time and money on an application for a particular school. Sadly, most schools never disclose such data. For those that do, the data might not be intuitive to be understood, More importantly, it is difficult to understand how exactly the measurements for each of the metrics factor into the final admission decision. Thus, we are very excited to start this project to visualize admission data with the aim of building an intuitive representation of the data. We found a dataset from UCLA on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions/version/2" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and we think it is a good start, especially given that there is such a scarcity of admission data and even less visualization with such data.

      <p class="text-center lead" >Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.</p>
      <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
      <p class="font-weight-light">
      How to effectively visualize each factor’s contribution to the application process? With so many factors of consideration in the application process, it would be nice to be able to visualize each one of them clearly and effectively.
      <p class="font-weight-light">  <u>Benefits: </u> </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Provide mechanism to compare and contrast one’s performance as compared to their peers on a factor-by-factor basis.</li>
        <li>Provide feedback for self assessment and allows students to understand where they fit in the academic spectrum.</li>
        <li>While college selection isn’t so cut and dry, it can be a good indicator of realistic options for future schools as well give some indicators on future academic achievement. Essentially, a good visualization can help students break down the obscure admissions process into concrete information of students’ performances in relevant metrics.</li>
        <li>Helps potential master students measure their chances of getting into a particular university. We, the developers could also learn something about a good school (e.g., UCLA)’s admission process.</li>
        <li>How to intuitively convey the potential admission result? Instead of handing out raw data in row-column tables, will it be more intuitive and understandable to visualize the final admission result? In our dataset, the original authors provide their machine learning analysis results to indicate the probability of admission for a particular student. We plan to label the ones with greater than 80% probability as “admitted” and the rest as “not admitted”. We want to use an intuitive visualization to convey this result to users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="font-weight-light">  <u>Benefits: </u> </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Intuitively convey the final result so users don’t need to dig into the rows and columns unless they really want to.</li>
        <li>Make the data interpretation process more fun and exciting.</li>
        <li>For us, we can sharpen our skills of using D3 to build a visualization that is intuitive, informative and useful.</li>
        <li>While we may not be able to fully formulate those questions until we have a solid data presentation, it will be interesting to see what relationships emerge once we have a proper data presentation.</li>

      <hr class="star-light mb-5">
      <p class="font-weight-light"><u>Milestone 1: </u> In Milestone 1, user selection had been implemented, but the water tank display was not. </p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/milestone1.png" alt=""><br>
      <p class="font-weight-light"><u>Milestone 2: </u> In Milestone 2, the user selection is modified, the tables are reconstructed, and water tank is implemented.</p>
      <p>Description: The left hand side is a panel where users could select an applicant's data to view.
Every applicant, numbered by a serial number, represented by a circle. The color of the circle indicates the applicant's
likelihood of being admitted to UCLA's graduate program. When a circle gets selected, it will change to a gold color and it will become larger. All the other circles that fall in the same class of likelihood are also highlighted. After that, users will ber able to see their selection's data, namely the values for each admission factor to populate the table. If the user is satisfied with the selection, the user could click the update button and the animation eill start in the panel to the right of the selection panel. Each factor , e.g. GRE, will be put on a balance, represented by a black ball proportional to its numeric value and the factor's weight in the admission process.It will be compared against the "standard" for that factor, which is calculated by taking the average of that factor among the applicants who are classified as being "highly likely" to be admitted. The animation will go through each factor and either pump water in or drain water out. For example, if the applicant's GRE score is higher than the "standard" GRE, water will be pumped.Otherwise, water will be drained. The amount of water being pumped or drained is proportional to the percentage difference and the factor's weight in admission. As you can see, GRE score is actually not so important in determining admission in our data. Eventually, if the water level in the tank is above the red line, it indicates that the applicant is highly likely to be admitted. </p>

        <li>The scope of the project is narrow for a 3-person team.</li>
        <li>Great color scheme and aesthetic. Maybe consider making it all in one page without having to scroll.</li>
        <li>I really like the aesthetic of the website, especially the form that you can use to calculate your chances.</li>
        <li>A lot of white space. Utilize it more!</li>
        <li>Add one more visualization?</li>
        <li>Very visually pleasing. However, it is unclear if this is for undergrad or grad school. the GRE field indicates grad school but I don't see it stated explicitly anywhere.</li>
        <li>Like they said in the presentation, would love to see more schools! And more transparency with how the scores are calculated.</li>
        <li>Great-looking visualization, simple but very effective. I think it could be made more obvious that you can edit the stats inside the boxes.</li>
        <li>If you manually change the chance of admittance, there's some weird behavior for some of the data points. I thought the visualization was awesome! The only thing I would change is to add more explanatory text that details a lot of the answers to the questions that were asked today. ie how the percentage was calculated.</li>
        <li>Could have explored more with website format, but otherwise great!</li>
        <li>The visualization on the first page could be bigger</li>
        <li>Honestly, really awesome graphics. It looks very clean</li>
        <li>very aesthetically pleasing, would like more variety</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="font-weight-light"><u>Takeaways: </u> We fixed a lot of the minor bugs/recommendations made by our peers. This includes numbers: 4-11. This was a smaller set of tasks was addresesd after the presentation. However, what took the most time was working on the additional two visualizations that we decided to include due to feedback numbers 1 and 5. To be completely transparent, we did have a completely different project scope in the beginning that visualized the chance of admission, which took quite a long time to implement. However, unfortunately with our timeline and current level of skill we were not able to implement it in a completely intuitive way. The old project effort can be found here: <a href=""></a></p>

            <p class="mb-5">I use a “balance” to weigh a factor (e.g., gpa = 3.74) against a pre-calculated “sufficient level” (e.g., “3.8”). The size of the ball represents the value of the factor (such as “3.74”). If the balance favors that ID (in this case 37) 's GPA,it drags the bar upwards toward the line marked as "admitted", otherwise it loosens it down to get closer to the line marked as "reject". Gradually, as we go through every factor (GPA, TOEFL, GRE, recommendation letter, etc.) it moves toward either rejection or admission. The strings between the balance and the purple bar acts as strings of control. The color of the objects are for pop-out effect only with no special meanings, for now. It is simple and intuitive but the largest problem is that. The key is, with this design it is harder to differentiate the different importance of two different factors (e.g., GPA v.s. GRE score) because every factor shares that “sufficient” marker and it is hard to differentiate the effects visually. </p>

            <p class="mb-5">This is a very rough sketch of a basic single page visualization that allows users to look at various graduate school applicant profiles. Each profile will show the variables that are taken into account during the graduate school admissions process. As the user clicks on a circle (representing an applicant profile), the page will move down and display a scatter plot with the selected user profile (highlighted and larger) compared with other user profiles (non-highlighted and smaller--to avoid clutter). On hover, the circles (profiles) will enlarge and show their respective variables.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The downside of this visualization is that it is not clear how certain variables affect chance of admission. Additionally, it may be a bit monotonous for the user to go back and forth from the top of the page to the bottom. Our final design should take these faults into account and make it clear which variables have stronger influence, in addition to making user interaction easy rather than tedious.</p>

The lower part of the visualization would be used for clusters of low chances of admission, while the higher part of the visualization would be used for higher chances of admission. The size of the bubbles would demonstrate the portion of applicants that fall into that range. Each bubble would contain various applicants that fell into the chance of acceptance rate represented.

            <p class="mb-5">The final design is an improvement of the first design with the “balance” and the “hanging bar”. It uses a water tank instead. In the above example with GPA, if the balance favors ID 37’s GPA against a pre-calculated standard/”sufficient” level, it opens the gate of the water pump and let water in. Otherwise, it opens the gate of the water drain and drains some water out. Gradually, as we go through every factor (GPA, TOEFL, GRE, ,recommendation letter, etc.) the water level goes up and down and eventually if it goes beyond the “admitted marker” this ID is admitted, otherwise rejected. The main improvement from the “hanging bar” design is that with water tank you can fill different amount of water to compare the importance of different factors (GPA vs GRE, the more important the more water coming in) but with the “hanging bar” it is harder to do that. Also, potentially, as the water tank design is inherently slightly more complex it can later convey more information from the each run’s water feature (color, “wave”) for more information. It is more expandable and flexible.</p>
